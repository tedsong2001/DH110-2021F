# Tentative: Government Websites for the Elderly
  ### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

## Description
  The project intends to examine how suitable government websites are for people aged 65+ years old. Two government websites will be used. Through this project, I hope to examine the problems in government websites that make them inaccessible to the elderly and to find solutions to such problems.
  
  The present assignment will apply the 10 Usability Heuristics to analyze the problems that the two government websites have and to evaluate the usability of the websites.

## Introducing the 10 Usability Heuristics
  ### 1. Visibility of System Status
  - Users need to be provided information about the current status. Users also need to receive feedback if an action is committed.
  
  ### 2. Match Between the System and the Real World
  - The design should easily make sense to the user. This involves the use of words and concepts that are already familiar to the user.
    
  ### 3. User Control and Freedom
  - Users should be allowed to make mistakes. This involves a design that enables the user to cancel an action and re-attempt.
    
  ### 4. Consistency and Standards
  - Words and concepts that are used should be consistent with the words and concepts used on other digital platforms.
    
  ### 5. Error Prevention
  - Designers should make sure that there are no error-prone conditions and that warnings are provided when an action is performed.

  ### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
  - The design of the interface should be oriented toward users' recognition rather than their recall.

  ### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
  - Shortcuts should be provided, making it easier for already experienced users to navigate--although the design should also be usable for inexperienced users as well.

  ### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
  - "Less is more." Designers should remove unnecessary details.

  ### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
  - Users should be provided a comprehensible error message and be suggested a solution.

  ### 10. Help and Documentation
  - In the case that users need extra help, help documentation should be easily noticeable and should provide steps that help the user perform an action.
