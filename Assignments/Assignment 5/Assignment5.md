# Low Fidelity Prototype
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Introduction
### User Research and Personas
User research indicated that the main problems of the [NV Accountancy](https://nvaccountany.com) had problems with text and organized. Users complained
about how the website used small texts which made it hard to read. Additionally, because there was so much text, the website also looked disorganized. Users had
a difficult time navigating the website. They felt that the website tried to include too much information. Additionally, the website had two features that appeared
to be menu bars but only one of them was actually a menu bar.

Two personas were used for the project. One persona was a Nevada student who wants to become a CPA but is unfamiliar with the
website and does not know where to go when it comes to finding information about requirements and exam. Another persona was a Nevada accountant who is familiar with the website but still finds the website inaccessible in that there
are problems when reading the small text and navigating the website.

## Purpose
The purpose of low fidelity prototypes is to have a quick, uncostly way of designing the layout of a potential website or app.
Additionally, low fidelity prototypes allow for users to go through the flow of a website or app, which then allows for designers to check whether their potential
design is usable, efficient, and helpful in the context of the user.

## Features to be Tested
One of the features that was tested is the use of a singular menu bar to navigate. User was instructed to find the exam instructions and the information about the
types of CPA applicants there are. User was also instructed to try to renew a CPA license and find the fees for renewal.

Another feature that was tested is better organization of information. A clickable box was used. When the box was clicked, the appropriate information would show up
on the right side of the screen. This would be tested by how the user reacted to the design.
