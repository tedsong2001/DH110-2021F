# Interface Design
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Description
The purpose of this interface design is to test how the user reacts to a redesign of the Nevada State Board of Accountancy website.
Specifically, a singular menu bar at the top, links on the homepage that guide (new and experienced) users, and organized layout were newly incorporated into the redesign.
This interface design focuses on how a new user, who is interested in being a CPA in Nevada, would use the website.
The interface design involves the user to navigate to the Exam Instructions page where information about the CPA application and exam is provided.
To create this interface design, I started with low-fidelity wireframes and digitized the wireframes with Figma.
