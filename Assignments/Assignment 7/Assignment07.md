## Introduction
This project seeks to improve and enhance the user experience of the website for the Nevada State Board of Accountancy.
The current page is specifically for high-fidelity prototyping of the website.

whether the proposed interaction flow works for the user.
In this process, the user will attempt to find the types of applicants there are for the CPA exam and to renew their CPA license.
