## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to allow the designer to take on the perspective of the users.
Storytelling forces the designer to consider the feelings and experiences of the user, which helps the designer to filter out their biases.
One method of storytelling is creating personas, where the designer organizes the user's characteristics, goals, and sentiments.
