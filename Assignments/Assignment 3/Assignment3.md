# Qualitative User Research
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Specifying the Main Design Challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This activity would support users to find more information about being a CPA. This will help people who are interested in working as an accountant but are unsure or who are interested in the qualifications necessary for that industry.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for this activity is the user's cognitive needs because they may be curious about a potential career. It may also fulfill the user's safety needs in that people who need to find the requirements of a certain career.

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution to satisfy the needs is looking online about a work and what they need to do. Another traditional solution is getting advice from people who already workers in industry.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A limitation that could be improved with digital technology is that we can make information about a career and what it takes to become one more accessible and readily available. Another limitation that could be improved is that people can know where to find such information again.


## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)?
- Demographic: college (years 18-22) students, studying in college
- Preferences: has an interest in careers in business, math, or economics
- Expertise: does not know much about what they want to pursue as a career

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?
Users would find information about Nevada CPAs on their devices with Internet on their free time. Users would typically do this because they are interested in information about CPA.

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
Users would look up education requirements and testing requirements entailed when it comes to becoming a CPA in Nevada. Users would also need to find where application forms are. Users would also need to find regulations and policies that CPAs in Nevada need to follow.

## Research Method
I chose to conduct a interview research.

## Observations
### About General Experience with Searching Careers
- User wanted a website that consolidated information about various careers.
- User had a hard time deciding which career seemed like a likely path for her.
- User seemed to have a hard time finding specific information about careers.

### About NVAccountancy.com
- I've noticed that the user really liked how there was a lot of information on the website. The user especially liked how the website consolidated information about what it takes to be a CPA. However, one main flaw that the user noticed was how compact the text was, making it hard to read.
- The user also brought up the idea of attention span. The user acknowledged having a short attention span, so it was preferable to have lesser text.
- Design was not welcoming, trustworthy, or modern. Better organization of the website was also needed
- User said that it was a good site to visit if people had an interest in becoming a CPA.
- When user found something that was personal, she displayed greater attention.

## Reflection
Career guidance seemed like a difficult subject for the user, so it would be beneficial for websites about careers to be more welcoming, friendly, and informative. I conducted this study with the expectation that the user would not like the excessive detail, but surprisingly, the user really liked the fact that there was a lot of details and steps to take when trying to become a CPA. This shows that there is benefit with having enough information. Still, the user had a hard time reading through the information, indicating that the website can improve with condensing and organizing its information. One thing that I would do differently is to ensure there is a stable connection because I had to restart the study (thankfully early on) because my wifi disconnected. Still, one thing that went very smoothly is that the user seemed to understand the questions that I asked and was comfortable with the tasks, so I think that I continue creating a comfortable environment and discussion with the participant for the next time I conduct another study.
