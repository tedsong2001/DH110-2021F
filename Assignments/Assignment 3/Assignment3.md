# Qualitative User Research
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Specifying the Main Design Challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?


## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
