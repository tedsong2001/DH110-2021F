# Qualitative User Research
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Specifying the Main Design Challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This activity would support users to find more information about being a CPA. This will help people who are interested in working as an accountant but are unsure or who are interested in the qualifications necessary for that industry.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for this activity is the user's cognitive needs because they may be curious about a potential career. It may also fulfill the user's safety needs in that people who need to find the requirements of a certain career.

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution to satisfy the needs is looking online about a work and what they need to do. Another traditional solution is getting advice from people who already workers in industry.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A limitation that could be improved with digital technology is that we can make information about a career and what it takes to become one more accessible and readily available. Another limitation that could be improved is that people can know where to find such information again.


## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)?
- Demographic: college (years 18-22) students, studying in college
- Preferences: has an interest in careers in business, math, or economics
- Expertise: does not know much about what they want to pursue as a career

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?
Users would find information about Nevada CPAs on their devices with Internet on their free time. Users would typically do this because they are interested in information about CPA.

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
Users would look up education requirements and testing requirements entailed when it comes to becoming a CPA in Nevada. Users would also need to find where application forms are. Users would also need to find regulations and policies that CPAs in Nevada need to follow.

## Research Method
