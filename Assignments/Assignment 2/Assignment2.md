# Usability Testing of Nevada Board of Accountancy Website
### Ted Song | Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Purpose Behind Usability Testing
This usability testing (UT) intends to gauge how people react to the current design of the [website](www.nvaccountancy.com).
The UT also intends to find out what type of problems the user bumps into, which signifies what designers should fix.
One problem with the website was that there was a menu bar on the left side that lists all the links.
This would create potential problems with consistency and standards since most websites typically have the menu bar at the top that expands when the user hovers over it.
To investigate this potential problem, the UT asked users to search for specific links on the menu bar.
Another problem with the website was that there was too much text on the website.
This would create potential problems with aesthetic and minimalistic design since there is too much information on the website.
To investigate this potential problem, users were asked to find specific details that were contained in blocks of text.
The excessive amount of information on the website would also create potential problems recognition vs. recall since the excess text would impede the ability to recognize certain features, thus forcing people to rely on recall.
To investigate this potential problem, users were asked to search for specific links on the menu bar to test whether their recognition of menu names corresponded with the location of the link (for example, recognizing the "Exam" menu and then expecting to find the "CPA Exam Education Req." link).
