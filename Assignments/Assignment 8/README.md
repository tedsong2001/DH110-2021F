# A Redesign of Nevada State Board of Accountancy of Website
### by Ted Song

## Introduction
This project was about evaluating a government website and redesigning it to enhance a user's experience of the website.
The Nevada State Board of Accountancy website is used primarily by people and organizations that work specifically in public accounting.
Thus, the website is the official source of information when it comes to public accounting in Nevada.
So, people who already work in Nevada's public accounting may be well versed in using the website.
However, there is also need to make the website friendly for new users who may be interested in public accounting in Nevada.
So, the goal for this project was to design the website so that the website is user-friendly for new users but is also not too different for users who were already familiar with the site.
